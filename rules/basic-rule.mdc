## Rule: Feature/Component Implementation Validation

After implementing any feature or new component:

1. **Run Playwright MCP checks**
   - Navigate through the website using Playwright MCP to verify the new feature/component works as intended.
   - Ensure tests include navigation, interaction, and UI validation.

2. **Server Usage Validation**
   - Always check if a server is already running on `localhost`.
   - **Do not** start a new server using `yarn dev` if one is already active.

3. **Package Manager Standardization**
   - Always use `yarn` over `npm` for dependency installation, scripts, and project management.
   - Commands such as `npm install` or `npm run` must be replaced with their `yarn` equivalents.

4. **UI Component Creation Standard**
   - Always use **Shadcn UI** to create any new UI component.
   - Ensure new components follow Shadcnâ€™s patterns, structure, and styling conventions.
   - Avoid using plain HTML/CSS or other UI libraries unless explicitly required.
